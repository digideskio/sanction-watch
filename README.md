# SanctionWatch.net

This is the source code of sanctionwatch.net, a tiny search engine for high-profile criminals, money launderers, and terrorist organizations. It currently indexes Canada's Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) sanction lists.

WARNING: This was mostly a toy project to get myself familiar with Sinitra and Solr/Lucene, so please do not really use it to implement your KYC policy :)

This code was mostly written in December 2009.
